# Kideny_Tumor_Detection
This project presents an AI-based system for detecting kidney tumors using advanced image segmentation techniques. It leverages the YOLOv8 model, known for its high accuracy and efficiency in medical image segmentation, to identify and segment abnormal tumor regions in kidney scans.supporting early detection and improved clinical decision-making.
